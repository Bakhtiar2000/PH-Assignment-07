        <h1>3. What is Event Loop and how does it work?</h1>
        <p>The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows for asynchronous operations to be executed in a non-blocking manner. It handles the execution of code in response to events such as user interactions, network requests, and timers. <br><br>
        The event loop works by continuously monitoring the call stack and the message queue.When an event is triggered, such as a user clicking a button or a network request completing, a message is added to the message queue. The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the message queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first message from the queue and pushes it onto the call stack. This results in the associated function being executed. If the call stack is not empty, the message remains in the queue until the call stack is cleared. <br><br>
        This process allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the execution of other code.

        <h4>#Explain the function quizTimer in brief</h5>
        <p>This function executes the 60s interval time after we get into the start quiz page. When this function is called without a parameter, it stops the timer by executing clearInterval(). But when called with a parameter, it initializes the timer with setInterval. The time is shown with a combination of minute and second. If the intervalTime exceeds 60s, the countdown will be shown in red color
        </p>
        <h4>#Explain the function chooseQuiz in brief</h5>
        <p>This function executes when we select an option from the quiz questions. It takes the value of answer that user have chosen and after few processing, passes it to the function displayAnswers to display the choice in the sidebar.</p>
